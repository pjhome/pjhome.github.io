<h1>More Wedding Details</h1>

<h2>Getting to the venue</h2>
<p>You have three options for your wedding day transportation.</p>
<h3>1. Lakeland Village Shuttles.</h3>
<p>Shuttles will be running from/to the lobby of Lakeland Village (Address: 3535 Lake Tahoe Blvd, South Lake Tahoe). 
<p><b>Getting to the venue:</b> The shuttles will begin departing Lakeland Village at 3:45 PM. The final shuttle will leave at 4:30 PM to make sure to get you to the venue on time. You‚Äôll see the shuttles when you come down the stairs from the lobby. There will be two shuttles, one branded Aladdin Limo and one branded Discover Lake Tahoe. If you don‚Äôt see the shuttles and you‚Äôre there before 4:30, please just wait a few minutes for them to return from making a trip.</p>
<p><b>Getting back to Lakeland Village:</b> The Discover Lake Tahoe shuttle will be making trips from the parking lot at the base of the tram, back to Lakeland Village from 11:10 PM - 12:10 AM.</p>
<h3>2. Driving</h3>
<p>There is plenty of parking at the base of the tram. You are actually welcome to leave your car there overnight and pick it up the next day, if at the end of the evening you want to carpool with a sober driver or use one of these other options to get home.</p>
<h3>3. Uber or Lyft</h3>
<p>In our experience (T-Mobile & AT&T), cell service is good in South Lake Tahoe and Uber/Lyft is readily available.</p>

<h2>A friendly reminder about altitude</h2>
<p>Our wedding is at 8,200 feet. High altitude, combined with the dry climate in Lake Tahoe, can leave you feeling unwell - especially when you‚Äôre drinking alcohol and tearing up the dance floor. We really want everyone to have a good time at the wedding, so please take it slow, pay attention to how you‚Äôre feeling, and most importantly, <b>stay hydrated all weekend.</b></p>

<h2>Wedding Day FAQs</h2>
<h3>What is the dress code?</h3>
<p>Semi-formal. <a href=https://www.thespruce.com/semi-formal-attire-guidelines-1216504>This article gives great guidelines for what that means.</a></p>

<h3>Will I be cold at the wedding?</h3>
<p>For bare arms, we‚Äôd recommend bringing a wrap or sweater. During the day, we expect the temperature on the mountain to be in the upper-60s - mid-70s and sunny. At night, the temperature could drop into the mid to low 50s, if it‚Äôs a cold night. The deck is heated with heat lamps and fire pits, but we‚Äôll be dancing inside if it seems too cold. (We both get cold easily, so you‚Äôre in good hands.)</p>

<h3>Are high heels a hazard?</h3>
<p>No. Feel free to wear your heels, as there is no grass or gravel that you must navigate at the venue. When arriving at the top of the tram, there is a small shuttle to take guests down to the ceremony site, if you want to use it.</p>

<h2>Important Details About Our Weekend Events</h2>

<h3>Welcome Picnic on Friday 7/19, 2pm - 6pm @ Regan Beach</h3>
<p>Parking is free here and the parking lot is quite large. Our area is a grassy hill at one end of the parking lot, across from Fresno Ave, you can see it in the map below:</p>

<p>We will have a bunch of games, snacks, drinks, and a taco truck for you to have a meal. We‚Äôll also have chairs and tables. There‚Äôs no need to bring anything (and please do not bring glass bottles) - unless you want to bring a blanket or a toy for the water (non-motorized - kayak, paddleboard, etc.)</p>

<h3>üé≤ Casino night üÉè on Friday 7/19, 9pm - 11pm @ Harrah‚Äôs</h3>
<p>Though not advertised on the invite, Jordan and I will be heading to Harrah‚Äôs in South Lake Tahoe on Friday night. Address: 15 US-50, Stateline, NV. If you‚Äôd like, please drop by and give us some good luck before the wedding!</p>

<h3>Brunch on Sunday 7/21, 9am - 12pm @ Lakeland Village - Lakeshore Pavilion</h3>
<p>We have reserved the upstairs Lakeshore Pavilion at Lakeland Village for our brunch buffet. If you‚Äôre staying on property, go to the building by the pool that‚Äôs by the lake and take the stairs up. If you‚Äôre staying elsewhere, Lakeland Village is at 3535 Lake Tahoe Blvd, South Lake Tahoe. You can park in the lot there (might want to try to carpool since we‚Äôve been told parking can be tight in the summer). Then head towards the lake. You will find the building right by the pier, and our brunch is upstairs. Here it is marked on the property map:</p>
