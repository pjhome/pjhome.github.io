<p class="first-line">Tinder isn't exactly the place to go looking for love, and we weren't.</p>

We were both 25, both somewhat newly single.

Jordan’s profile: “I cook, I ski, I backpack, I’m an entrepreneur” (still true)<br>
Paige’s profile: “Just looking for a guy in SF with a washer/dryer”  (also still true...except for the guy part!)

When we matched, Paige recognized someone in Jordan’s profile picture: her classmate from Berkeley, who it turned out was Jordan's roommate and one of his best friends. So we had this instant connection and familiarity. And as we starting exchanging messages, we were each thinking: this person seems so real and genuine -- they make me feel safe. As much as we both love adventure, this was kind of an irresistible feeling.

The feeling continued through our first date at Club Deluxe, a jazz bar in the Haight, Paige's 'hood. Jordan didn’t have a washer/dryer, but he had a charming smile, and warm eyes that didn't miss much. And Paige struck Jordan as down-to-earth, sweet, and "just about as far as you can go towards being really smart while still being normal." She put Jordan at ease on what it turned out was his first ever Tinder date (talk about swiping him up!).

<p class="first-line">We kept going on dates; we were falling for each other.</p>

Initially, our friends and family tried to persuade us to date other people (that was the point of our 20s, right?!), but they forgot about it after they saw us together. We didn't necessarily have all that much in common: Paige was a semi-cool nerdy kid from SoCal who loved reading and art, and Jordan was a semi-nerdy cool kid from NorCal who loved cooking and building things. But when we went out to dinner, we ended up amusedly eavesdropping on the same conversations. When it came to what we wanted to get out of a party or a vacation, we had the same idea of a good time. We just saw things in the same way, a way that used to make us feel weird and alone sometimes. As we opened up and found that we understood and accepted each other completely, the world started to feel like a safer place.

<p class="first-line">That's what's made it possible for us to face some of the hardest, scariest stuff we've ever done.</p>

Early on, Jordan literally saved Paige's life; we were hiking down Half Dome in a sudden rainshower, when Paige fell. Jordan caught her. A year or so later, Jordan got in an accident of his own doing yard work, and Paige held his hand in the hospital room and swore to never let him go. Since we've been together, we've taken the biggest risks of our lives: Jordan left his job at a local market to hustle full-time at his sustainable food startup, and Paige left her job at Google to pursue her dream of being a writer. Sometimes we feel like we don't know how it's all going to work out. But we've always been sure about each other, and that's made everything possible.

Somewhere along the line, we started referring to ourselves as "the team" (among other silly nicknames). And on November 4th, 2017, Jordan asked Paige to marry him on a picnic blanket on a bluff by the ocean, in front of the Golden Gate Bridge. Jordan designed the ring himself, resetting the diamonds from his paternal grandmother's engagement ring (fun fact: her maiden name is J's middle name, LaPides). Of course, Paige thought it was perfect.

<p class="first-line">Engaged life has been sweet, and we can't wait to tie the knot.</p>

Before we met, we could have only dreamed about the cosy house in Bernal Heights that we get to share, cooking dinner, singing duets on the guitar, gardening, and watching our favorite shows. We even have a blast going to Trader Joe's. And we can't believe how lucky we are to have adopted each other's families and friends. We love you guys and can't imagine our lives without you -- thanks for being part of our story.

When we started planning our wedding, we were looking for somewhere everyone could stay close together and have a lot of fun stuff to do. And we wanted to get married in a beautiful, natural setting. When we didn't find anything that quite fit the bill in the San Francisco area, we thought about Tahoe.

<p class="first-line">Tahoe is a special place for us.</p>

For nearly his whole life, Jordan's come there every winter to ski. For Paige, falling in love with J has meant falling in love with skiing too (and finally tackling some black diamonds!). But coming up to look at venues, we realized that Tahoe in the summer is almost even more magical -- we started to get excited thinking about enjoying the lake with our family and friends, including people who have never had the chance to visit this amazing place.

We decided to get married at a lodge that's part of the Heavenly ski resort in winter -- so we'll ride the tram up to the top, and have our ceremony overlooking Lake Tahoe. We can't think of a more perfect way to celebrate the things we love, or a more perfect place to have an unforgettable weekend with all of you. We can't wait for July 20th!
