</center>

We wanted to give everyone the option to stay close together, so we've picked a few hotels located on the same block in South Lake Tahoe. (Another incentive to stay here: we're hoping to provide shuttles to/from the wedding.) Tahoe's busy in the summer, so we recommend you make your plans soon to have the best choices.

## Lakeland Village Resort

We'd recommend you check this option first (P + J are staying here!). The property is affiliated with Heavenly, and we're getting a special discount through the wedding planners. We may have a good option for hosting some of the weekend's events here, too (still working on the details!). The rates are highly competitive for the area, especially if families or friends end up staying together, as the bigger condos offer the best value. The minimum stay is 2 nights.

<b>Book:</b> On the website <b><a href="https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Chain=6521&Dest=HVL&template=SAHV&shell=SUMSAHV&arrive=7/18/2019&depart=7/21/2019&adult=2&child=0&promo=GH4DRSW" target="_blank">here</a></b>. Or book by phone: 1-855-221-4337. On the web, the prices you see are already discounted. Over the phone, to get the discount, you'll need to give the booking agent the promo code <b>GH4DRSW</b>, or just mention our names.

## Tahoe Lakeshore Lodge & Spa

This property is literally right next door to Lakeland Village. We were able to get a 10% discount for our guests. The amenities are slightly different, but the rates for a single room are a little better than Lakeland Village. There are fewer great options for large groups, though. For arrivals on Friday or Saturday, the minimum stay is 3 nights.

<b>Book:</b> View rooms on the website <b><a href="www.tahoelakeshorelodge.com" target="_blank">here</a></b>, then call 1-800-448-4577 to make your booking with the discount.

To receive the 10% discount, mention you are reserving for the <b>Schwartz & Dunn-Rankin Wedding Group</b> over the phone (sorry, they weren't able to set this up online for us).

## Postmarc Hotel and Spa Suites

While we haven't been able to get a personal discount here, the prices are quite reasonable for the season, with the lowest rates for single rooms of the three (they don't offer condos, only suites). This hotel doesn't have access to a private beach or pool like the other two do, but the rooms look nice, and there is no minimum stay if you're just popping up for 1 night.

<b>Book</b>: On their website <b><a href="https://www.postmarchotels.com/en-us" target="_blank">here</a></b> or by phone at 530-541-4200. (They emailed to tell us they always provide "20% off" when you book directly on their site or by phone.)

<center><h1>- Other Options -</h1></center>

There are plenty of great hotels in South Lake Tahoe, these are just the ones we recommend and we like that they're located very close together. But there are even other hotels on the same block, we just tried to pick the ones that we thought offered the best value and amenities. So feel free to shop around!

<b><a href="airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a></b> and <b><a href="vrbo.com" target="_blank">VRBO</a></b> are also great options in South Lake Tahoe, especially if you're coming with a big group (you might have read news about regulations restricting rentals, but they won't go into effect until 2020).
