<p class="title">Saturday, July 20:&ensp;Ceremony & Reception</p>
<p class="details">
Our wedding is at about 8,000 ft. elevation at Lakeview Lodge, which is part of Heavenly Mountain Resort. After riding up the Aerial Tram with fellow guests, you'll reach the lodge. The ceremony is outdoors on a concrete patio. There will be a cocktail hour on the deck followed by a buffet dinner inside the lodge, and then we'll return to the heated deck for dancing.</p>

The Aerial Tram leaves from the parking lot at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wh7VMmbAfHS2">3860 Saddle Rd, South Lake Tahoe, CA 96150</a><br>

<b>Attire:</b> Semi-formal<br></p>
<p class="details">
<br><b><i>Important note:</i></b> The venue likes to start things on time, and they have a strict rule that the tram stops running during the ceremony. Therefore, we ask that you be at the tram by 4:30, and please don't be late! Seriously...we've heard some horror stories about guests missing the tram and the whole ceremony. (After the ceremony, the tram will be running all night.)</p>
