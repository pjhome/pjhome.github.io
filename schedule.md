<p class="details">Come join us for an afternoon at the lake! We'll have drinks, a taco truck (come hungry!), lawn games, and some seating. There's a pier for launching kayaks and paddleboards and a small beach. There's a big grassy area where we'll be hanging out.<br><br></p>

<p class="title">Saturday, July 20:&ensp;Ceremony & Reception</p>
<p class="details">
Our wedding is at about 8,000 ft. elevation with amazing views of Lake Tahoe (PSA: stay hydrated!). The ceremony is outdoors on a concrete patio. Dinner will be held inside the lodge and dancing will be outside on the deck.</p>
<br>
<p class="datetime">
<b>Where:</b> Heavenly Mountain Resort, Lakeview Lodge<br>
The tram up to the ceremony & reception site leaves from the parking lot at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wh7VMmbAfHS2">3860 Saddle Rd, South Lake Tahoe, CA 96150</a><br>
<b>When:</b> Ceremony starts at 5 pm, last tram up at 4:45 pm<br>
<b>Attire:</b> Semi-formal<br></p>
<p class="details">
<br><b><i>Important note:</i></b> The venue likes to start things on time, and they have a strict rule that the tram stops running during the ceremony. Therefore, we ask that you be at the tram by 4:30, and please don't be late! Seriously...we've heard some horror stories about guests missing the tram and the whole ceremony. (After the ceremony, the tram will be running all night.)</p>
