<b>Welcome Picnic at the Lake</b><br>
Come join us for an afternoon at the lake! We'll have drinks, a taco truck (come hungry!), lawn games, and some seating. There's a pier for launching kayaks and paddleboards and a small beach. There's a big grassy area where we'll be hanging out.<br>
<b>Where:</b> Thomas F Regan Memorial City Beach<br>
<a href=https://goo.gl/maps/iX3Tj431Zg22>3199 Sacramento Ave, South Lake Tahoe, CA 96150</a><br>
<b>When:</b> 2pm - 6pm (feel free to stop by any time!)<br><br>

Friday evening, we'll probably go out to the casinos and see if we can get lucky before we tie the knot.

<b>Ceremony & Reception</b><br>
Our wedding is at about 8,000 ft. elevation with amazing views of Lake Tahoe (PSA: stay hydrated!). The ceremony is outdoors on a concrete patio. Dinner will be held inside the lodge and dancing will be outside on the deck.
<br>
<b>Where:</b> Heavenly Mountain Resort, Lakeview Lodge<br>
The tram up to the ceremony & reception site leaves from the parking lot at this location:<br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wh7VMmbAfHS2">3860 Saddle Rd, South Lake Tahoe, CA 96150</a><br>. 
<b>When:</b> Ceremony starts at 5 pm, last tram up at 4:45 pm
<br>Getting married on top of a mountain presents some unusual logistics as we get everyone up the tram to the ceremony and reception site! The venue likes to start things on time, and they have a strict rule that the tram stops running during the ceremony. Therefore, we ask that you be at the tram by 4:30, and please don't be late! Seriously...we've heard some horror stories about people being late and missing the ceremony here. (After the ceremony, the tram will be running all night.)
